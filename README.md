# URL Shortener – Single-Company, Role-Based System (Laravel)

This project implements a **secure, invitation-based URL Shortener system** using  
**PHP Laravel (10 / 11 / 12)** and **SQLite**, following the exact functional  
specifications provided.

The system supports **one single company**, multiple users, and **3 user roles** with  
strict permissions around **invitations**, **URL creation**, and **URL visibility**.

---

# 📌 Project Summary (From Specification)

You are implementing a service that allows users to generate short URLs under a  
**single-company architecture**.

### System Rules
- The service **must NOT support multiple companies**.
- A single company may have **multiple users**.
- Users belong to that company and have exactly one of these roles:
  - **SuperAdmin**
  - **Admin**
  - **Member**

---

# 🎯 Requirements (Implemented)

### ✔ Framework
- **Laravel 10 / 11 / 12**

### ✔ Database
- **MySQL**

### ✔ Authentication
- Users can **log in** and **log out**
- Session-based authentication with Laravel middleware

### ✔ Authorization
Access rules enforced through middleware, policies, and controller checks.

### ✔ Seeder
A **SuperAdmin** user is created using a **RAW SQL database seeder**.

---

# 🔐 Role Definitions

## 🟥 SuperAdmin
- Highest privilege user.
- Cannot create short URLs.
- Cannot view “all-company” URL lists  
  (even though the system is single-company, this restriction is preserved per specification).
- **Cannot invite an Admin into a *new* company** (since multiple-company mode is forbidden).
- Can invite:
  - Admin (into existing company only)
  - Member

---

## 🟦 Admin
- Belongs to the single existing company.
- **Can invite:* 
  - Member  
- Can only invite roles that are permitted (e.g., business-limited staff roles if needed).
- **Can create short URLs.**
- Can only view short URLs **not created inside their own company**.

*(In a single-company system, this effectively filters out URLs generated by users of the same company.)*

---

## 🟩 Member
- Cannot invite users.
- **Can create short URLs.**
- Can only view **URLs not created by themselves**.

---

# 🔗 URL Shortener Rules (PER SPEC)

- **SuperAdmin**  

Only system-permitted internal processes (if defined) may generate URLs.

| SuperAdmin | Cannot see full list of all short URLs in the company |
| Admin      | Can see **ONLY URLs created inside their own company** |
| Member     | Can see **ONLY URLs created by themselves** |

---

### 🔒 URL Access (NON-PUBLIC)

  - Timestamp

---

# 🧪 Test Requirements (PASSED)
